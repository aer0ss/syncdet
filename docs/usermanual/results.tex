\section{Viewing Reports and Logs}

\subsection{Reports}
At the end of running a scenario, SyncDET will generate reports for each test
case and scenario that was run on remote actors. The location of these reports
is displayed at the end of the SyncDET test run. These reports typically
contain information on the status of the test. If a test failed, the report
indicates why (timeout, exception, etc.).

\subsection{Logs}
Any test case that emits output will have that output collected and copied
to the controller in the form of a log. The log directory is located at
{\tt [SyncDETRoot]/logs/}. Inside this directory, each scenario that was
previously run will generate a folder with a timestamp representing that
scenario. A symlink {\tt latest} will point to the log folder of the latest
scenario test run.
