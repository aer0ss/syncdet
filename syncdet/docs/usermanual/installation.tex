\section{Installation}

\subsection{System Requirements}

Running SyncDET requires one or more UNIX, Linux, or cygwin systems. 
The controller (master) system has only been tested for OSX and requires the
following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Python 2.7+ installed
\item {\tt git}, {\tt tar}, and {\tt grep}.
\end{enumerate}
The requirements for each actor system (slave) follow:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Python 2.6+ installed.
\item An {\tt ssh} daemon server installed and running; future support can be made for
{\tt telnet} or {\tt rlogin} if desired. The controller system should be able to login
without entering a password.
\item Commands {\tt ps}, {\tt grep}, {\tt tar}, and {\tt sed} installed. {\tt ps} must
support the option {\tt -eo pid,cmd}, which lists all processes with a PID and a
command line per row.
\end{enumerate}
