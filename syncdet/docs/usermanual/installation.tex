\section{Installation}

\subsection{System Requirements}

Running SyncDET requires one or more UNIX, Linux, or cygwin systems. 
The controller (master) system has only been tested for OSX and requires the
following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Python 2.7+ installed
\item {\tt git}, {\tt tar}, and {\tt grep}.
\end{enumerate}
The requirements for each actor system (slave) follow:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Python 2.6+ installed.
\item An {\tt ssh} daemon server installed and running; future support can be made for
{\tt telnet} or {\tt rlogin} if desired. The controller system should be able to login
without entering a password.
\item Commands {\tt ps}, {\tt grep}, {\tt tar}, and {\tt sed} installed. {\tt ps} must
support the option {\tt -eo pid,cmd}, which lists all processes with a PID and a
command line per row.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Acquiring Source Code}
\begin{verbatim}
$ mkdir ~/repos; cd ~/repos
$ git clone ssh://z.arrowfs.org/repos/aerofs.syncdet
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Actor VMs}
SyncDET-ready virtual machines have been created for Linux, OSX Leopard, Windows
7 and Windows XP. They are shared as bzipped tarballs in an AeroFS library
somewhere (ask Mark or Weihan). They satisfy the system requirements listed
above, except for passwordless ssh; you must copy over your public key. To
extract the linux VM, for example:
\begin{verbatim}
$ tar -xvf syncdet-ubuntu1110_32.tar.bz2 -C <parent directory of VM>
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Systems Configuration}
You must manually configure the actor and controller systems. 

\paragraph{Actors} 
List the hostname or IP address of all systems to be used as actors in \\*
{\tt [SyncDETRepo]/syncdet/systemsdef.py}. Specifically modify the d\_systems
dictionary:
\begin{verbatim}
# the dictionary definition of the systems
d_systems = [
            { 'address': '192.168.1.16' },
            { 'address': '192.168.1.17' },
            ]
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Controller} 
Specify the hostname of the controller from which you will launch
SyncDET scenarios, by modifying {\tt [SyncDETRepo]/syncdet/config.py}:
\begin{verbatim}
# the address or the host name of the controller
CONTROLLER_ADDR = "192.168.1.15"
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Running the Demo Scenario}
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd [SyncDETRepo]/syncdet
$ ./det -f default.scn
\end{verbatim}
