\section{Introduction}

SyncDET is a distributed experimentation and testing harness, intended to
facilitate the execution of distributed software {\em scenarios}. The tool
consists of a {\em controller} system which deploys and synchronizes {\em actor}
systems that play out the desired scenario.

In this user manual the system requirements and installation are covered,
followed by an introduction to scenarios and the {\em test cases} embedded
within them, concluding with instructions to write your own test cases.
